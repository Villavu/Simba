Getting Started with Simba
==========================

This page will help you install Simba and highlight some basic Simba
features.

Installing simba
----------------

Installing Simba is pretty straighforward and will only take a couple of
minutes.

.. _simba-installer:

Simba installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Everyone can download Simba at http://wizzup.org/simba/
Go to download and download the Simba installer.

Once it is done downloading, simply run the installer and follow the steps.

.. note::
    Simba will install to C:/ by default; if you want to install it
    somewhere else, make sure you select a different location!
    If you are running Windows Vista or Windows 7, then you will probably want
    to install it to C:/ or another place; as long as writing in the actual
    directory does not require administrator permissions. C:/ is a safe bet.

    You can install Simba to your ``Program Files`` directory, but you will have
    to run Simba as administrator in that case.

Simba will probably tell you there is an update available. In this case, an
update button will appear. Click it and the Simba Updater will show up.
Alternatively you can update Simba using Tools -> Update.

.. note::
    Updating Simba regularly is recommended.

Downloading Simba binary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is harder and not recommended. Steps on how to do this will follow later.

For now, simply stick to the installer and update Simba after the install has 
completed.

Setting up SRL 4 with Simba
---------------------------

If you were using the :ref:`simba-installer` then you can simply enable the
``SRL Updater`` extension. (Go to View -> Extensions and enable ``srl.sex``)

See :ref:`simbaext` for more information on Extensions.

This is the only supported way. You can simply do a svn checkout on the srl
repository, but if you can do that, then you should be able to set up SRL
yourself as well.

Setting up SRL 5 with Simba
---------------------------

This will follow later, upon SRL 5 release. (Which will be quite soon)

Installing scripts
------------------

Scripts can be downloaded with the Script Manager, in Tools -> Script Manager.

.. note::
    The Script Manager is not finished yet.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you run into problems that are not mentioned here, make sure you look at
the :ref:`Troubleshooting` page.
