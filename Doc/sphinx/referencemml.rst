MML Reference
=============

The Mufasa Macro Library is the core library of Simba. It is used not just to
provide scripts with the required functionality, but also used to pick colours
and select windows with Simba itself. The MML can run without any user
interface.

The MML is split up in "Core" classes and "Addon" classes. 

.. note::
    This section needs to explain more on the core/addon differences,
    and provide some more general info about the mml.
